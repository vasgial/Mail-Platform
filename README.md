# Mail-Platform
 build a console application where you will be asked to read various inputs from the keyboard.
 
 This application is not defined in terms of what it is but it is defined as to what it is expected to be doing in principal.
 
 These inputs will be used as login details and as various actions to give the ability to the users of the system to interact with each other.
 The interaction between the users is solely defined by you so you can decide,
 •What kind of information you would like your users to interchange
 •How often this information has or must be exchanged
 •The role that each user has within the application
 
 The output of the various subsystems will be displayed to the screen and it will be written to simple text files.
 
 The following description of the logical units of the application is given to have a guideline to what it should be expected as minimum requirements.

 1.Main application
